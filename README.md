## 🧍‍♂️ A Little More About Me
  
- I take coding personally — if it works, it’s a win; if it breaks, I fix it till it listens!  
- I’m from Uzbekistan 🇺🇿 and currently in the UAE 🇦🇪 — I speak Uzbek, English, and some Russian  
- I’m the type of guy who says “I’ll just test this one more thing…” and then it’s 4 AM 😅  
- Coffee is my debugger ☕ (and sometimes my breakfast)  
- I’m always building something — even if no one sees it. Ideas don’t wait!  
- If I ever go quiet, I’m either coding… or writing a poem.
